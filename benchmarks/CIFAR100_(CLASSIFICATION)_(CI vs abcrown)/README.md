# CI vs ABCrown

Due to scalability limitations associated with deterministic algorithms, we chose to conduct our comparison in a lower-dimensional space. In this section, we evaluate the efficiency of our technique in comparison to Alpha-Beta-Crown (ABCrown) on a classification task. It is important to note that this experiment focuses exclusively on classification, a simpler task, and does not address semantic segmentation.
